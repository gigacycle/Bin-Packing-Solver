# Bin Packing Solver
This MATLAB code (implemented in 2012) provides solutions to the bin packing problem using various optimization algorithms including ant colony algorithm, simulated annealing algorithm, genetic algorithm, tabu search algorithm, and particle swarm optimization algorithm.

## Bin Packing Problem
The bin packing problem is an optimization problem, in which items of different sizes must be packed into a finite number of bins or containers, each of a fixed given capacity, in a way that minimizes the number of bins used. The problem has many applications, such as filling up containers, loading trucks with weight capacity constraints, creating file backups in media, and technology mapping in FPGA semiconductor chip design.

## Usage:
To run each solution, execute the corresponding MATLAB file:
- For the Bee Colony Algorithm: run 'beeColony.m'
- For the Simulated Annealing Algorithm: run 'sa.m'
- For the Genetic Algorithm: run 'ga.m'
- For the Tabu Search Algorithm: run 'ts.m'
- For the Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm: run 'pso.m'

Each MATLAB file contains the implementation of the respective algorithm to solve the bin packing problem. Additional parameters or configurations can be adjusted within the MATLAB files if needed.
